The .Do File includes STATA code written for a graduate class on surveys and survey experiments. (! Additional explanations in the .DO File are written in German)

More specifically, linear regressions are conducted to analyze the influence of several individual attributes on climate policy preferences for a treatment group and a control group.
The treatment group was given the scenario that the top carbon dioxide (CO2) emitters fail to meet the Paris Climate agreement commitments; the control group was given the scenario that top CO2 emitters succeed in meeting the commitments. 
The attributes are: age, political ideology, income, interest in current political developments/following the news, climate change awareness, and expected economic and international consequences should CH fail to meet the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement.
